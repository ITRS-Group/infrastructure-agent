\par
2. VISUAL STUDIO INTELLICODE SERVICE.\par
\par
a. AI-assisted IntelliSense Service. This service provides a base model trained on publicly available open source code that enables you to receive AI-assisted IntelliSense suggestions. The base model will enable you to receive AI-assisted IntelliSense suggestions for common types and components. You may use the base model, in whole or in part, only with the software. The service also provides the facility to train any number of team completion models on your own applications. These team completion models are for your use and use by those with whom you wish to share. (See 2.c. below for the definition of a team completion model.)\par
\par
b. Your Data. AI-assisted IntelliSense analyzes your application locally to generate a summary file with metadata on the types and their usage across your application which illustrate your patterns of usage. The summary file contains information about the names of classes, methods, and how often they are used in your application (\ldblquote Your Data\rdblquote ). You retain ownership of all aspects of Your Data, including, but not limited to, all right, title and interest in and to the underlying application code.\par
\par
c. Team Completion Model.\par
\par

You may copy and install those items onto your devices to debug and deploy your applications and databases you developed with the software. The Utilities are designed for temporary use. Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software. Some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access the devices on which the Utilities are installed. You should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of devices, or of the applications or databases on devices, on which Utilities have been installed.\par

Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft\rquote s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://aka.ms/privacy }}{\fldrslt{https://aka.ms/privacy\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .

Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in these license terms.

\par
\'b7 work around any technical limitations in the software;\par

You may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\par
\par
a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these license terms is intended to affect those rights.\par

In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\par
\par
13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \ldblquote AS-IS\rdblquote . YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED\par
