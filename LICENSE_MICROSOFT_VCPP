Preview features may be used consistent with your use rights to Visual Studio Community. Preview Channel software and preview features (collectively, “previews”), the Preview Channel, and Current Channel are further described at https://aka.ms/vs/17/channels-overview. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. They may not operate correctly or work the way a final version will. Microsoft may change previews for the final, commercial version, if any. Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you for previews.

2. VISUAL STUDIO INTELLICODE SERVICE.

a. AI-assisted IntelliSense Service. This service provides a base model trained on publicly available open source code that enables you to receive AI-assisted IntelliSense suggestions. The base model will enable you to receive AI-assisted IntelliSense suggestions for common types and components. You may use the base model, in whole or in part, only with the software. The service also provides the facility to train any number of team completion models on your own applications. These team completion models are for your use and use by those with whom you wish to share. (See 2.c. below for the definition of a team completion model.)

b. Your Data. AI-assisted IntelliSense analyzes your application locally to generate a summary file with metadata on the types and their usage across your application which illustrate your patterns of usage. The summary file contains information about the names of classes, methods, and how often they are used in your application (“Your Data”). You retain ownership of all aspects of Your Data, including, but not limited to, all right, title and interest in and to the underlying application code.

c. Team Completion Model.

i. You may submit Your Data to Microsoft through the AI-assisted IntelliSense service for the sole purpose of enabling Microsoft to create a team completion model. The team completion model is an AI-assisted IntelliSense set of recommendations based on Your Data. By submitting Your Data to Microsoft, you give Microsoft the right and license to copy, modify, create derivative works of, and transform Your Data to create a team completion model. Microsoft will not use Your Data or the resulting trained machine learning of the team completion model for any other purpose.

ii. You may use the team completion model, in whole or in part, only with the software.

3. TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. a. Utilities. The software contains items on the Utilities List at https://aka.ms/vs/17/utilities. You may copy and install those items onto your devices to debug and deploy your applications and databases you developed with the software. The Utilities are designed for temporary use. Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software. Some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access the devices on which the Utilities are installed. You should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of devices, or of the applications or databases on devices, on which Utilities have been installed.

b. Build Devices and Visual Studio Build Tools. You may copy and install files from the software or from Visual Studio Build Tools onto your build devices, including physical devices and virtual machines or containers on those machines, whether on-premises or remote machines that are owned by you, hosted on Microsoft Azure for you, or dedicated solely to your use (collectively, “Build Devices”). You and others in your organization may us these files on your Build Devices solely to compile, build, and verify applications developed by using the software, or run quality or performance tests of those applications as part of the build process.
